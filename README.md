# An Analysis of Political Advertisements on Facebook

As part of our Data Visualisation (TDS3401), we've decided to analyze the [Political Advertisements from Facebook](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/political-advertisements-from-facebook) dataset to come up with interesting visualisations.

## Preprocessing
Since the original dataset is huge (~3 GB), we've performed preprocessing to derive suitable datasets beforehand for each visualisation. These preprocessed datasets can be found in `public/datasets/`

## Running Locally

- Ensure to have [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed
- `npm install` to install the required dependencies
- `npm start`  to launch a development server

## Disclaimer

This visualisation is made entirely for education purposes only and is not intended to be politically motivated.
