Let's be more civil now. That's what Jesus would do.\" No, that isn't what Jesus would do. Jesus never, ever gave in to the money changers in the temple. He never gave in to the Pharisees and Sadducees. He never... gave in to the Sanhedrin, which was the oppressive Jewish government at the time. He never gave in to the Romans. He never gave in to the crowds who chanted for him to be killed. Instead he stood firm. Instead he spoke the truth to them no matter what they said and did. He did not cave. He did not run away. That's why in the end they whipped him, and beat him, and laughed at him, and spat at him. That's why they killed him. Nice? Civil? No, that is not what Jesus would do. Stand firm? Speak the truth to power? Make sacrifices for the good of his fellow human beings for the sake of justice? Yes. That's what Jesus would do. That's what we're going to do as well. \"Loving our enemies\" does not mean caving to evil. We are to pray for them and speak the truth to them. Then we are to stand firm. We are not Jesus but Jesus told us to follow him. He told us to carry the cross every day. He told us to do what he did. And that's what we've attempted to do for 10 years, every day.

I had to man up and make the change. Not easy but they changed first.‚Äù ‚Äî         At Penzeys, we believe cooking set our humanity in motion. Our nearly one million years gathered together around the fire taught us true strength does not come from driving others away, but from welcoming others in. The kindness of tens of thousands of generations ...of Cooks created our humanity, but racism, sexism, and homophobia can all too easily undermine the goodness Cooks work so selflessly to create in the world. As a business of Cooks, we have decided, for better or worse, we won‚Äôt sit idly by while this happens. Yesterday I was forwarded an email that stated that I had called all Republicans racists and anarchists. I also received another email that said, ‚ÄúYour comments echo those of the desperate left who have no message for the nation other than that of ‚ÄúAll Trump Supporters Are Racist!‚Äù First off, I don‚Äôt believe any human is truly an anarchist. How is anarchy something you can believe in? Not to say that people haven‚Äôt posed as anarchists to create a reason to justify crackdowns, or possibly simply to get dates, but no, I‚Äôve never called Republicans anarchists. And on the charge that I‚Äôm somehow echoing others calling all supporters of the President racists, I don‚Äôt think I was echoing anyone on that notion, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was right there hitching the horses to that bandwagon. One week after the 2016 election I wrote in an email: \"The open embrace of racism by the Republican Party in this election is now unleashing a wave of ugliness unseen in this country for decades. The American people are taking notice. Let's commit to giving the people a better choice. Our kindness really is our strength.\" In sifting through the replies to that email it was clear that, though not intended, a good number of people seemed to sincerely believe in my statement I was calling all Republicans racists. In the replies from those Republicans who did not vote for the party's nominee, I sensed genuine pain at having the strength of character to not go along with what was happening, but nonetheless be grouped in with those who did. I apologized and said ‚ÄúYou are your party's future, and you deserve my admiration and respect, and your country's as well.‚Äù I did go on: ‚ÄúFor the rest of you, you just voted for an openly racist candidate for the presidency of the United States of America. In your defense, most of you did so without thinking of the consequences of your candidate's racism because, for most of you, the heartbreaking destruction racism causes has never been anything you or your loved ones have had to experience. But the thing is, elections have their consequences. This is no longer sixty years ago.  ‚ÄúWhether any of us like it or not, for the next four years the 80% of this country who did not just vote for an openly racist candidate are going to treat you like you are the kind of person who would vote for an openly racist candidate. You can get angry at everyone else for treating you like you just did the thing you just did, or you can take responsibility for your actions and begin to make amends.‚Äù Two years and tens of thousands of emails trying to convince me otherwise, haven‚Äôt.  Voting in the 21st century for what Paul Ryan labeled before the election ‚Äútextbook‚Äù racism is indeed an act of racism. The impact on all Americans, whatever their skin tone, of saying you are fine with open racism, or at least don‚Äôt see how it should disqualify a candidate for the presidency of the ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù States of America, is a very real and very racist impact caused by your vote.  Does committing a racist act make you a racist? I think the answer to that comes in your response to what you have done and in what you do going forward. Where my thinking has changed in these past two years is that I no longer believe you have to go out of your way to make amends for who you voted for in the past election. All you have to do to make amends for helping to put the president in the White House is to stop supporting him and those who enable him.  For reasons I still have not quite figured out, our last post really took off and now has over 25,000 comments. In those comments are many much like the one this post starts with that speak to the difficulty of choosing the values the writer was raised with over loyalty to the party they were raised to believe in. That‚Äôs not an easy step‚Äîmore of a leap really. It takes strength. As another customer put it: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the label you have slapped on yourself not reflect the truth of what you believe. I grew up in a Republican family, and heck, even my mom isn‚Äôt Republican anymore.‚Äù Right now the President is going to great lengths to distance himself from the language of hate that he uses towards immigrants, the press, his previous opponents, and pretty much any American that lives outside the narrow demographic of his support. Instead of taking responsibility for his words, he‚Äôs pushing the false notion that those who oppose him are the ones driven by hate and anger. This simply isn‚Äôt true. Hate doesn‚Äôt drive people to work for racial equality, transgender rights or the welcoming of asylum seekers. What drives us to care about others is our humanity, something Cooks have in abundance.  From the likes and warm, positive comments received by those coming to grips with the reality that holding onto their beliefs means letting go of their party, I can tell you that you won‚Äôt find any hate on the other side, just kind decent people looking to support you for your courage. Now really is the time to choose who you want to be and what you want to stand for. And my thanks to all the Penzeys supporters for the kindness, strength, and compassion found in your comments. Your spirit makes what we do possible. Don‚Äôt forget, through Monday $6 I Will Vote Kind Boxes, $1 Turkish Oregano, and $1 Bavarian Seasoning. Tuesday we will be closed and giving our people a paid holiday to vote. If you have a business you should do this, too. No coupons or codes needed for any of these offers in our stores or online at penzeys.com. Feel free to pass these along.  You can see the $19.95 value Vote Kind Box here: https://www.penzeys.com/‚Ä¶/i-will-vote-kin‚Ä¶/c-24/p-3113/pd-gb The regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano here: https://www.penzeys.com/‚Ä¶/turkish-broken-le‚Ä¶/c-24/p-744/pd-s And the regularly $3.95 Bavarian Seasoning over here: https://www.penzeys.com/‚Ä¶/bavarian-style-sea‚Ä¶/c-24/p-19/pd-s We are doing the I Will Vote Boxes as part of our Get Out The Vote efforts. They are really nice.  The Turkish Oregano is great, and great Oregano makes for a good life. The Turkish people do a good job with so much, including Oregano and investigating the murder of journalists. Was a reporter for an American newspaper killed because, with America‚Äôs reduced standing in the world these past two years, they thought they could get away with it? Or did they do this to win favor with a President that, time and again, has encouraged his supporters to commit violence against those that report on his actions? Either way, this is not good. Our thanks to the quality investigative work of the Turkish government for exposing this in a way where our president has to deal with it.  And Bavarian Seasoning, too. I love how so many Americans have tried to figure out how to respond to what is happening and how to use their skill set to make a difference. A customer sent me this link to a truly great example from PBS travel host Rick Steves: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-lis‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶/tv-show/fascism Maybe it‚Äôs just coincidence that has Mr. Steves addressing so very effectively the rise of fascism in Europe at just this time, but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not. One of the points he makes is our belief that it can‚Äôt happen here, it can only happen in places like Germany, is simply wrong. Germany had great art, they cared enough to create a great food culture, they invented kindergarten. The reality is, if it could happen there, it could happen anywhere. Watch this if you have the chance and pass it along to others. This is amazing work. Thanks for the recommendation.  And thanks for having the kindness to care for the world around you. You really do heal the world, Bill Penzey bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly, leaving a comment helps overcome the extra hurdles our posts face because of our ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people. With what this week is sure to be, please share this with anyone you know who could use a reminder that many who once supported this are now turning away. This is a time for hope. And please share the importance of voting. You are more respected than you imagine. You have the power to Get Out the Vote of those around you. Please use it. Thanks.","impressions":"6","sentiment":{"magnitude":0.20000000298023224,"score":-0.20000000298023224},"conclusion":"negative"},{"text":"Paul Ryan needs a reality check!

I had to man up and make the change. Not easy but they changed first.‚Äù ‚Äî         At Penzeys, we believe cooking set our humanity in motion. Our nearly one million years gathered together around the fire taught us true strength does not come from driving others away, but from welcoming others in. The kindness of tens of thousands of generations ...of Cooks created our humanity, but racism, sexism, and homophobia can all too easily undermine the goodness Cooks work so selflessly to create in the world. As a business of Cooks, we have decided, for better or worse, we won‚Äôt sit idly by while this happens. Yesterday I was forwarded an email that stated that I had called all Republicans racists and anarchists. I also received another email that said, ‚ÄúYour comments echo those of the desperate left who have no message for the nation other than that of ‚ÄúAll Trump Supporters Are Racist!‚Äù First off, I don‚Äôt believe any human is truly an anarchist. How is anarchy something you can believe in? Not to say that people haven‚Äôt posed as anarchists to create a reason to justify crackdowns, or possibly simply to get dates, but no, I‚Äôve never called Republicans anarchists. And on the charge that I‚Äôm somehow echoing others calling all supporters of the President racists, I don‚Äôt think I was echoing anyone on that notion, I‚Äôm pretty sure I was right there hitching the horses to that bandwagon. One week after the 2016 election I wrote in an email: \"The open embrace of racism by the Republican Party in this election is now unleashing a wave of ugliness unseen in this country for decades. The American people are taking notice. Let's commit to giving the people a better choice. Our kindness really is our strength.\" In sifting through the replies to that email it was clear that, though not intended, a good number of people seemed to sincerely believe in my statement I was calling all Republicans racists. In the replies from those Republicans who did not vote for the party's nominee, I sensed genuine pain at having the strength of character to not go along with what was happening, but nonetheless be grouped in with those who did. I apologized and said ‚ÄúYou are your party's future, and you deserve my admiration and respect, and your country's as well.‚Äù I did go on: ‚ÄúFor the rest of you, you just voted for an openly racist candidate for the presidency of the United States of America. In your defense, most of you did so without thinking of the consequences of your candidate's racism because, for most of you, the heartbreaking destruction racism causes has never been anything you or your loved ones have had to experience. But the thing is, elections have their consequences. This is no longer sixty years ago.  ‚ÄúWhether any of us like it or not, for the next four years the 80% of this country who did not just vote for an openly racist candidate are going to treat you like you are the kind of person who would vote for an openly racist candidate. You can get angry at everyone else for treating you like you just did the thing you just did, or you can take responsibility for your actions and begin to make amends.‚Äù Two years and tens of thousands of emails trying to convince me otherwise, haven‚Äôt.  Voting in the 21st century for what Paul Ryan labeled before the election ‚Äútextbook‚Äù racism is indeed an act of racism. The impact on all Americans, whatever their skin tone, of saying you are fine with open racism, or at least don‚Äôt see how it should disqualify a candidate for the presidency of the ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù States of America, is a very real and very racist impact caused by your vote.  Does committing a racist act make you a racist? I think the answer to that comes in your response to what you have done and in what you do going forward. Where my thinking has changed in these past two years is that I no longer believe you have to go out of your way to make amends for who you voted for in the past election. All you have to do to make amends for helping to put the president in the White House is to stop supporting him and those who enable him.  For reasons I still have not quite figured out, our last post really took off and now has over 25,000 comments. In those comments are many much like the one this post starts with that speak to the difficulty of choosing the values the writer was raised with over loyalty to the party they were raised to believe in. That‚Äôs not an easy step‚Äîmore of a leap really. It takes strength. As another customer put it: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt let the label you have slapped on yourself not reflect the truth of what you believe. I grew up in a Republican family, and heck, even my mom isn‚Äôt Republican anymore.‚Äù Right now the President is going to great lengths to distance himself from the language of hate that he uses towards immigrants, the press, his previous opponents, and pretty much any American that lives outside the narrow demographic of his support. Instead of taking responsibility for his words, he‚Äôs pushing the false notion that those who oppose him are the ones driven by hate and anger. This simply isn‚Äôt true. Hate doesn‚Äôt drive people to work for racial equality, transgender rights or the welcoming of asylum seekers. What drives us to care about others is our humanity, something Cooks have in abundance.  From the likes and warm, positive comments received by those coming to grips with the reality that holding onto their beliefs means letting go of their party, I can tell you that you won‚Äôt find any hate on the other side, just kind decent people looking to support you for your courage. Now really is the time to choose who you want to be and what you want to stand for. And my thanks to all the Penzeys supporters for the kindness, strength, and compassion found in your comments. Your spirit makes what we do possible. Don‚Äôt forget, through Monday $6 I Will Vote Kind Boxes, $1 Turkish Oregano, and $1 Bavarian Seasoning. Tuesday we will be closed and giving our people a paid holiday to vote. If you have a business you should do this, too. No coupons or codes needed for any of these offers in our stores or online at penzeys.com. You can see the $19.95 value Vote Kind Box here: https://www.penzeys.com/‚Ä¶/i-will-vote-kin‚Ä¶/c-24/p-3113/pd-gb The regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano here: https://www.penzeys.com/‚Ä¶/turkish-broken-le‚Ä¶/c-24/p-744/pd-s And the regularly $3.95 Bavarian Seasoning over here: https://www.penzeys.com/‚Ä¶/bavarian-style-sea‚Ä¶/c-24/p-19/pd-s We are doing the I Will Vote Boxes as part of our Get Out The Vote efforts. They are really nice.  The Turkish Oregano is great, and great Oregano makes for a good life. The Turkish people do a good job with so much, including Oregano and investigating the murder of journalists. Was a reporter for an American newspaper killed because, with America‚Äôs reduced standing in the world these past two years, they thought they could get away with it? Or did they do this to win favor with a President that, time and again, has encouraged his supporters to commit violence against those that report on his actions? Either way, this is not good. Our thanks to the quality investigative work of the Turkish government for exposing this in a way where our president has to deal with it.  And Bavarian Seasoning, too. I love how so many Americans have tried to figure out how to respond to what is happening and how to use their skill set to make a difference. A customer sent me this link to a truly great example from PBS travel host Rick Steves: https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-lis‚Ä¶/‚Ä¶/tv-show/fascism Maybe it‚Äôs just coincidence that has Mr. Steves addressing so very effectively the rise of fascism in Europe at just this time, but I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs not. One of the points he makes is our belief that it can‚Äôt happen here, it can only happen in places like Germany, is simply wrong. Germany had great art, they cared enough to create a great food culture, they invented kindergarten. The reality is, if it could happen there, it could happen anywhere. Watch this if you have the chance and pass it along to others. This is amazing work. Thanks for the recommendation.  And thanks for having the kindness to care for the world around you. You really do heal the world, Bill Penzey bill@penzeys.com Liking this post, liking our FB page, and more importantly, leaving a comment helps overcome the extra hurdles our posts face because of our ‚Äúpolitical‚Äù belief that cooking is what happens when you care about people. With what this week is sure to be, please share this with anyone you know who could use a reminder that many who once supported this are now turning away. This is a time for hope. And please share the importance of voting. You are more respected than you imagine. You have the power to Get Out the Vote of those around you. Please use it. Thanks.","impressions":"6","sentiment":{"magnitude":0.20000000298023224,"score":-0.20000000298023224},"conclusion":"negative"},{"text":"I don't take a dime from conservative billionaires, but Paul Ryan cannot say the same.

Ends Sunday 9.23.18 We had scheduled last weekend and this weekend for our Fox Point not Fox News offer a while back. And we had pre-positioned the Trial Size bags of Tsardust Seasoning waiting... for the the next shoe in the Russia probe to drop, but we did not know when that would be. When the President‚Äôs campaign chairman plead guilty to ‚ÄúConspiracy against the United States‚Äù and agreed to cooperate fully with the Robert Mueller Russia probe, it seemed this was a mighty big shoe, and a good time for a reminder of the humanity of the Russian people. With Paul Manafort‚Äôs agreement to full cooperation, Robert Mueller is now in the room where it happened. Any chance there once was for the truth to remain hidden has now passed. If indeed there was conspiring between the Russian government and this administration and the time comes to hold someone accountable, it should not be the Russian people. It should be those controlling their country, and possibly those controlling ours as well. Time will tell, but while we wait, Tsardust Memories! What comes next with the investigation one way or the other will be memorable in its own right. If the truth is Russia did help ‚Äúfix‚Äù our election, wars between nations have been started for less. Tsardust Memories is a very tasty blend that celebrates the history of the humanity of the Russian people. You don‚Äôt come up with such a truly pleasing combination of flavors without generations of Cooks trying their best to make something nice for those they cook for. The boat we in America have been in since the 2016 election is a boat the Russian people have been in for decades. We should try to keep them as allies in this struggle.  Though we had not planned for Fox Point, Not Fox News, and the Tsardust offers to run at the same time, but once they did, the story they create when placed side by side leads to a striking conclusion. When thinking about Fox News, and at the same time about Russia, where else can your mind honestly go other than the reality that Fox News has pushed America to be far less like America and far more like Russia? There are good reasons the founders so treasured a free and skeptical Press. Once any media becomes the propaganda arm of any political party, like Fox is to the Republican Party, the freedom of all people is at risk. We have this struggle on our hands because we‚Äôve let Fox be viewed as journalism.  The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin‚Äôs version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they‚Äôve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don‚Äôt want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything. At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let‚Äôs do all we can to keep it that way.  This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40. Shop without stressing about shipping charges at penzeys.com now.

Ends Sunday 9.23.18 We had scheduled last weekend and this weekend for our Fox Point not Fox News offer a while back. And we had pre-positioned the Trial Size bags of Tsardust Seasoning waiting... for the the next shoe in the Russia probe to drop, but we did not know when that would be. When the President‚Äôs campaign chairman plead guilty to ‚ÄúConspiracy against the United States‚Äù and agreed to cooperate fully with the Robert Mueller Russia probe, it seemed this was a mighty big shoe, and a good time for a reminder of the humanity of the Russian people. With Paul Manafort‚Äôs agreement to full cooperation, Robert Mueller is now in the room where it happened. Any chance there once was for the truth to remain hidden has now passed. If indeed there was conspiring between the Russian government and this administration and the time comes to hold someone accountable, it should not be the Russian people. It should be those controlling their country, and possibly those controlling ours as well. Time will tell, but while we wait, Tsardust Memories! What comes next with the investigation one way or the other will be memorable in its own right. If the truth is Russia did help ‚Äúfix‚Äù our election, wars between nations have been started for less. Tsardust Memories is a very tasty blend that celebrates the history of the humanity of the Russian people. You don‚Äôt come up with such a truly pleasing combination of flavors without generations of Cooks trying their best to make something nice for those they cook for. The boat we in America have been in since the 2016 election is a boat the Russian people have been in for decades. We should try to keep them as allies in this struggle.  Though we had not planned for Fox Point, Not Fox News, and the Tsardust offers to run at the same time, but once they did, the story they create when placed side by side leads to a striking conclusion. When thinking about Fox News, and at the same time about Russia, where else can your mind honestly go other than the reality that Fox News has pushed America to be far less like America and far more like Russia? There are good reasons the founders so treasured a free and skeptical Press. Once any media becomes the propaganda arm of any political party, like Fox is to the Republican Party, the freedom of all people is at risk. We have this struggle on our hands because we‚Äôve let Fox be viewed as journalism.  The Russian people have struggled for so long because for too long the only news available to them was the Kremlin‚Äôs version of Fox News. For decades they simply called this The Truth (Pravda), but in more recent years they‚Äôve controlled the news by silencing real journalism through any means necessary. As much as we really don‚Äôt want to end up where they are, it is pretty clear this is the direction the President and his party are trying to take us. Right now, resistance means everything. At the heart of cooking is the understanding that when you make the effort to care about others the world becomes a better place. Sadly the desire to make the world a better place is not universally held. There was a time when the good parts of religion were a voice that reminded all of us that greed and hurting others for the gain of power and money is just plain wrong. As that voice has become sidelined, now is the time for Cooks to step up and share our values and speak out against what Fox would have our nation become. With Tsardust Memories we can enjoy the tastiness of Russian food in America without having to experience their way of government in America. Let‚Äôs do all we can to keep it that way.  This weekend we are offering free shipping (Alaska and Hawaii, too) with just $25 in spending rather than the usual $40. Shop without stressing about shipping charges at penzeys.com now. This weekend we also have an $11.90 value, two free 1/4-Cup jars of Fox Point Seasoning with just $5 in spending. And we are offering regularly $2.95 Turkish Oregano and regularly $4.29 Apple Pie Spice for just $2 each.
